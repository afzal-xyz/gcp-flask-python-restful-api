# Flask-Python RESTful APIs Using Google App Engine


It is a boilerplate project for creating RESTful APIs using Flask-Python framework and then deploy them on Google App Engine. 
It consists of two classes Tasks and TaskList. Task let you create, delete, update a single task while TaskList let you perform 
same operations on list of Tasks. Main goal is to facilitate these operations through RESTful APIs which can be called either from web or from mobile.
